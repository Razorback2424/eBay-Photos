# Export validation checks

Run `python export_validation.py --dir-export <path>` after completing an export to
ensure naming and file counts are correct. Provide `--zip-export` with the fallback
archive to confirm both delivery modes remain in sync. Use `--expect-warped` when the
export enabled warped fronts.
